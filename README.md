# Serverless Development on AWS Kiro Power

A comprehensive Kiro Power for building and deploying serverless applications with AWS Lambda, SAM, API Gateway, and the complete AWS serverless ecosystem.

## Overview

This power provides AI-assisted serverless development with AWS best practices built-in. It integrates with the [AWS Serverless MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-serverless-mcp-server/) to give you access to the complete serverless development lifecycle.

## Features

### 🚀 Serverless Application Lifecycle
- **Project Initialization**: Create new SAM projects with templates and best practices
- **Local Development**: Test Lambda functions locally with Docker containers  
- **Build & Deploy**: Compile, package, and deploy to AWS with CloudFormation
- **Monitoring**: Retrieve logs and metrics for debugging and optimization

### 🌐 Web Application Deployment
- **Full-Stack Apps**: Deploy complete applications with Lambda Web Adapter
- **Frontend Assets**: Manage S3 hosting with CloudFront distribution
- **Custom Domains**: Configure Route 53 DNS and ACM certificates
- **Updates**: Hot-swap frontend assets with cache invalidation

### ⚡ Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Source Mappings**: Configure Lambda triggers for DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, Kafka
- **EventBridge Integration**: Type-safe event handling with schema registry
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize ESM configurations
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose connectivity and performance issues

### 📊 Observability & Optimization
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Logs, metrics, and alarms
- **X-Ray Tracing**: Distributed tracing and performance analysis
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing and efficiency recommendations
- **Security Best Practices**: IAM policies and VPC configurations

## Usage

### Activation Keywords
The power activates when you mention:
- `serverless`, `lambda`, `sam`
- `api gateway`, `aws`, `deployment`
- `cloudformation`, `event-driven`
- `microservices`, `backend`, `web app`

### Example Prompts

**Create a new serverless project:**
```
I want to build a serverless API for a todo application using Python and AWS Lambda. Can you help me set up a new SAM project?
```

**Deploy a web application:**
```
I have a React frontend and Express.js backend. Help me deploy this as a full-stack serverless application on AWS.
```

**Optimize performance:**
```
My Lambda function is experiencing high latency. Can you help me analyze the performance and optimize the configuration?
```

**Troubleshoot issues:**
```
My DynamoDB stream processing is falling behind. The iterator age is increasing. Help me diagnose and fix this issue.
```
